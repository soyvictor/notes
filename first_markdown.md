## Lecture 1: CV, Linkedin, and github (with Juan Carlos)

### Notes

* LinkedIn is absolutely a good idea but it's not that important.
* CV and Github are the most important.
* You need to make a good first impression with your CV. Not too much design - unless maybe you're going for a front end job.
* Do not put a career objective.
* Numerical values are important.
* Github they will ask you about it and about your projects.
* Ignore the job requirements.  They don't actually expect you to meet all the requriements.  It's hard to find programmers.  If you have 1-2 things on the list of requirements, it's good enough.
* Don't lie.
* No personal summary.  The order for you should be :
    * Work experience
    * Projects
    * Education
    * skills/interests
* Put 3-4 bullets per job
* Highlight skills (targeted)
* No photograph.
* Volunteer work only if it's related to tech.
* Check out
    * canva - CV templates
    * <flowcv.io>
* Send your resume to JC Banos for review.
* A PM job resume would be different - need to highlight management roles more.
* Finding a new job and submitting resume:
* Emails, networking events, conventions, colleges, networking on Kitt or other batches.
* Indeed, Angel List.
* Clean code doesn't matter too much, maybe only at places like google where they care about clean code.  If it works, it works.
* What the hell is a Hash? (VC).
* Refactor your code if you can.
* One page resume unless very high up.
* Being a programmer alone is not good, be proud of your previous work experience and show it.
* Portfolio should have links to your projects...
* Cover letter, customize for jobs you really want, otherwise use a template.  But it's a must in U.S.
* Cover letter - why does the company interest you, and why is it a good fit for you, why are you a good fit for them.
* Make sure to commit to Github everyday!!
* Projects should have a readme, and description of code.  Make sure your last commit of each project is good.  That is what potential employers will see.
* Backend positions: your Github is your portfolio.  Put your challenges on Github.
* Technical skills - endorsement on Linkedin.

From Andrea:

The objectives for today (that can flow into tomorrow) :coffee:  <https://bit.ly/CVworkshop_lw>
1. Build your CV - (follow slides for best practices :nail_care:)
2. Refine your LinkedIn - (follow slides to get the best reach :briefcase:) <https://bit.ly/linkedin_lw>
3. Read the Career Playbook :point_down:
<https://github.com/lewagon/career>
4. Post your LinkedIn profile here, add your classmates (if you haven’t already) and go to their profile to endorse them - you guys are more than qualified to be endorsed in Ruby on Rails, Git, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, etc..  it only takes 3-5 clicks and will add more legitimacy to your profile as a developer.
5. Write some recommendations for your classmates too! You can ask someone to recommend you, but make sure you write one back if someone writes one for you.
6. Assemble a list of all of the social links you want to link on your portfolio site. This means your github (did you add a short bio? a good picture? ), your Medium, your LinkedIn, your Instagram, etc etc.

7. Pick a domain name for your site and purchase it. Some useful tips: use a .com, .me, .tech, or a .io domain. Do not use .co as it often gets flagged as spam
8. If you haven’t already, fork your final projects, your airbnb projects, and Mr. Cocktail and clean up the front end.
:slack: us for any question and enjoy the first day of your new journey :wink::+1:
