    let x = 1
    let y = 3
    let dog = x + y;

```js
let x = 1
let y = 3
let dog = x + y;

hey did you try `var x = 2;`?

## Lecture 1: CV, Linkedin, and github (with Juan Carlos)

### Notes

* LinkedIn is absolutely a good idea but it's not that important.
* CV and Github are the most important.
* You need to make a good first impression with your CV. Not too much design - unless maybe you're going for a front end job.
* Do not put a career objective.
* Numerical values are important.
* Github they will ask you about it and about your projects.
* Ignore the job requirements.  They don't actually expect you to meet all the requriements.  It's hard to find programmers.  If you have 1-2 things on the list of requirements, it's good enough.
* Don't lie.
* No personal summary.  The order for you should be :
    * Work experience
    * Projects
    * Education
    * skills/interests
* Put 3-4 bullets per job
* Highlight skills (targeted)
* No photograph.
* Volunteer work only if it's related to tech.
* Check out
    * canva - CV templates
    * <flowcv.io>
* Send your resume to JC Banos for review.
* A PM job resume would be different - need to highlight management roles more.
* Finding a new job and submitting resume:
* Emails, networking events, conventions, colleges, networking on Kitt or other batches.
* Indeed, Angel List.
* Clean code doesn't matter too much, maybe only at places like google where they care about clean code.  If it works, it works.
* What the hell is a Hash? (VC).
* Refactor your code if you can.
* One page resume unless very high up.
* Being a programmer alone is not good, be proud of your previous work experience and show it.
* Portfolio should have links to your projects...
* Cover letter, customize for jobs you really want, otherwise use a template.  But it's a must in U.S.
* Cover letter - why does the company interest you, and why is it a good fit for you, why are you a good fit for them.
* Make sure to commit to Github everyday!!
* Projects should have a readme, and description of code.  Make sure your last commit of each project is good.  That is what potential employers will see.
* Backend positions: your Github is your portfolio.  Put your challenges on Github.
* Technical skills - endorsement on Linkedin.

From Andrea:

The objectives for today (that can flow into tomorrow) :coffee:  <https://bit.ly/CVworkshop_lw>
1. Build your CV - (follow slides for best practices :nail_care:)
2. Refine your LinkedIn - (follow slides to get the best reach :briefcase:) <https://bit.ly/linkedin_lw>
3. Read the Career Playbook :point_down:
<https://github.com/lewagon/career>
4. Post your LinkedIn profile here, add your classmates (if you haven’t already) and go to their profile to endorse them - you guys are more than qualified to be endorsed in Ruby on Rails, Git, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, etc..  it only takes 3-5 clicks and will add more legitimacy to your profile as a developer.
5. Write some recommendations for your classmates too! You can ask someone to recommend you, but make sure you write one back if someone writes one for you.
6. Assemble a list of all of the social links you want to link on your portfolio site. This means your github (did you add a short bio? a good picture? ), your Medium, your LinkedIn, your Instagram, etc etc.
<https://bit.ly/pimpmyGithub>
7. Pick a domain name for your site and purchase it. Some useful tips: use a .com, .me, .tech, or a .io domain. Do not use .co as it often gets flagged as spam
8. If you haven’t already, fork your final projects, your airbnb projects, and Mr. Cocktail and clean up the front end.
:slack: us for any question and enjoy the first day of your new journey :wink::+1:

### Job offers platform:
in this platform you will find all the job offers for Le Wagon Mexico students. <https://lewagon.lapieza.io/> You can create a profile, upload your CV, add a Bio, and more!

Juan Carlos: Hey guys,  Andrea posted the slides for todays workshop so all the resources are there. Use them to make your CVs, Github and linked in profiles today. If you want me to look over your CV, linked in and Github please send me a message and if you have a question also message me or leave a message in this thread! Good luck!!

### Notes

* Make sure have green commits on github at least once or twice a week make a commit.
* Put embedded contact form in your portfolio.

* React VUE, JS, Middleman, Vue is top JS framework, Use gatsby react for your portfolio.
* Check out Wufoo form, zapier.
* Select your best work.
* BULMA
* Go for just a front end frame work, loads faster and doesn't require a rails server.

## Lecture 3: How to launch your startup (with Benjamin Hernandez)

Validate - if someone is willing to pay you even $100, do the project.  But don't do any work until then.  Don't go to friends/family.  Go to a business.

check out accelerator programs, and something called startup weekend.

## Lecture 5: How to land your first job as a developer (with Ignacio)

[Ignacio's markdown notes](https://gist.github.com/nachoal/ee11404c004931c39a72dc0276b7bc9e)

* hackmd.io

bundle open [gem name]
bundle list
bundle open rails

* Try to spend an hour a day reading open source code.  It will help a lot more than writing code.
    * gem list search in google.
    * ruby gem list top.

* iTerm 2
* gem dl in computer
* read JS code in github

* Twitter is great for networking.

* Always under promise and over deliver

* indiehackers
* nomadlist.com -- making 24k/month, 38k/year
* kalzumeus - don't call yourself a programmer - read
* Eloquent Ruby book
* The pragmattic programmer (start with this one)

* Use exercism - you will get a mentor
* juanitofatas ruby
* eloquent JS is very technical, lots of CS terms.
* project on github - follow on github

* watch and doing
* UI.dev
* Tyler McGinnis
* wesbos.com
* Udemy

Ignacio will answer on slack... and can read CV if you want.


## Lecture 6: Interview and technical interview (with Juan Carlos)

* Study behavioral questions...look up BAR interview protocol. Background, Action, Results to explain anything during the behavioral part of the interview.  Give numerical answers is best.
* Prepare for generic bar questions - 10-20.  Have answers ready.
* Technical questions - it's more about your thought process.
* How many footballs can fit in a football stadium.  volume of ball, volume of stadium.  They don't expect the exact answer....or something silly like 10% of 375.  Silly math questions, that surprisingly a lot of people get wrong.
* Algorithms/ solve problems, like reverse an array without using any built in methods.
![image of reverse array problem](https://res.cloudinary.com/vc334/image/upload/v1594438942/99110AC9-D7E0-405C-ACB9-39B2AE787942_ssvefr.jpg)
* mutable - you don't want to change the original array.  Put it into a new array.
* global scope / local scope - they'll ask you to trace output or to write a method/function.
* Paper test - sql query -- usually some simple stuff they'll ask you like how would you search in database for something from something....
* Design a website from scratch 30 minutes -- demonstrate you can deconstruct a website into its parts...navbar, banner, footer, cards.. divs.
* Best way to create a table in HTML??
* Research the company.  it's hard to find good coders.  you don't need to get all tests correct, you just need to get 50% to 60% and you'll pass...
* normally they automatically disqualify people who don't get 50% or 60% or whatever their threshold is, and from there, they base on other factors like personality.
* bootcamps - best one is medium size for graduates.
* if want to do a mock interview with Juan Carlos, message him.



## Lecture 7: Frontend roadmap and intro to react (with Daniel Polo)

[Link to Daniel's notion page](https://www.notion.so/Frontend-Roadmap-4c6addcf52484e70a1c30299475e493f)

### Notes

* read html tagshtml forms<audio><video><picture> tags
* CSS is hugestop using libraries like bootstrap
* Manually achieve bootstrap stuff
* w/css you can achieve stuff without javascript
* focus is for forms
* disabled is for buttons, lower capacity
* :first, :first-child 
* nth-child()
* required is for forms like email and password is required
* active - pressure maintained on button
* Animations in CSS
* CSS is best when obvious you need a grid
* responsive first for mobilemaster media queries
* sass / scss (preprocessors) - nested properties, create functions, variablesCSS you can create variables--var(red)
* in client you need to learn JS...
* ruby runs in server only
* only programming language run in browser is JS
* servers have API, use fetch
* rails frame work preprocesses everything...
* DOM manipulation is with server
* many different events...
* event is like a hook

courses...

* JS has lots of interactions with browser/hardware...etc
* redux store data in client - persist it react to build interface
* framework manages your libraries, handles routing, and other stuff...
* Vue you can launch a app in a few hoursAngular is framework by google (difficult to learn)JS programming part happens in client
* react native - variation of react - one code base - android and ios
* Electron desktop apps - allows you connect hardware and file system
* lighthouse is a tool by googel - performance tester
* capybara is for ruby but not good for SPA - single page appsdoes not reload routes, just gets sources with ajax
* react is not a framework, it's a library to build an interface
* react app:
* npx command
* npx create
* react are functions in JS that return HTML


## Lecture 8: Coding Challenges (with Juan Carlos)

* Program Trace
* Use Python tutor to trace code for you on their website -- helps with debugging and learning.

* almost all languages follow the global/local scope concept.

* Recursion: method calls itself within teh method.  Makes problem smaller and smaller until it goes away.

* Check out crakcing the code interview - bible for coding interviews.  used so much that recruiters no longer ask questions from there.  Check out HackerRank for challenges to do.

## Lecture 9: Intro to other coding languages (with Omar )

### Notes:
* C/C++ are low level languages.  like Ruby is built on C/C++.  Highly recommend to learn these to learn more about the core of software development fundamentals.*

* Assembly language is even lower.

* Java, C, C++ are not easy to learn but worth the trouble.*

* You can do android app dev with Java - it's safe and reliable, been around for 20 years.

* Python is popular.  It' similar to Ruby, similar to plain English.  Great for backend.

* Data science - Python - well paid - has framework Django - follows restful API.

* C# is good for app development (Microsoft).

* 60% of ios is built in objective C; you should know it even if you code in Swift.

* Android is built with Kotlin.

* React Native vs. swift/kotlin.

* Typescript is static language (requires you to declare variable type)...I think it's related to JS.

    Javascript is really powerful - you can build an entire app with it...
    frontend, backend, mobile.
    angular, node, mobilaps
    vue
    JS

* React is a library; it's not a framework.

* Learn react and then react native.

* When learning react, learn react classes - components as classes.  class compnents instead of functional components.  learn this well then you will understand lifecycle of a component.   after this, you canlearn more about whos reducts, graph QL.

* Omar recommends learning more about front end to understand web development as a whole better.  Learn more front end frameworks.
