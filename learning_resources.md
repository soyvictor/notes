Regarding some of these UX questions that you've been asking, here's a really handy ebook from a recently popular website that teaches design to developers with actionable useful steps and suggestions, the site is: https://refactoringui.com/

This is it, I would suggest that you skim through it and apply some of the suggestions that they make, most of the tips are quick fixes but it will make a huge difference in your design for the better

Check out the book - I dl it to my computer already.
